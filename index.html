          The game of Pigs is a dice game with simple rules. Here are the basic
          rules of the game:
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The game is played with two players taking turns. On each turn, a
          player rolls a dice. </li><li>The player accumulates points based on the sum of
          the dice rolls.</li> If the player rolls a 1 on the dice, their turn ends,
          and they lose all points accumulated in that turn. - It's called
          "pigging out."</li><li> If the player rolls any other number, they can choose
          to roll again and add to their current points, or they can end their
          turn and bank their accumulated points. </li><li>The player can continue
          rolling as long as they avoid rolling a 1 or choose to stop and bank
          their points.</li><li> The first player to reach a winning point total (50)
          wins the game.</li>
        </ul>
